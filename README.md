My name is Daniel Ruiz and I am in my last quarter in the UCLA Master's in Urban and Regional Planning program. As a part of my studies, I am concentrating in Community Economic Development and Housing. 

I created this file as a part of the Urban Planning 206A course. This course is titled "Introduction to GIS and Spatial Data Science". The purpose of this course is to grow familiar with how to utilize different data-science tools in order to better visual and explore different social phenomena. 

A possible project idea that I have for the course includes being able to create visuals that emphasize how differences in socioeconomic status lead to divergent life outcomes for individuals across the United States. This could include how differences in education, housing, income, healthcare access, or many other factors influence the social and economic outcomes faced by individuals nationwide. 

My objective for the course is to ultimately have a better understanding of what different types of data-science tools are available and to be able to create compelling visuals based on these tools.
