**UP 206 Week 3 Reading Assignment**
  
  This week's readings include two readings by Geoff Boeing titled "Off the Gridâ€¦ and Back Again? The Recent Evolution of American Street Network Planning and Design" and "OSMnx: New methods for acquiring, constructing, analyzing, and visualizing complex street networks." Both of these readings discuss different elements of data analysis, with the "OSMnx" reading discussing Boeing's python module that he built with the intent of analyzing Open Street Map data and the "Off the Grid" reading discussing how street networks in America have evolved over time including what role data science has played in this process. According to the "OSMnx" reading, OSMnx is a tool that facilitates the data creation and analysis process by providing specific mapping features which allow researchers and practitioners to more easily visualize street networks. One thing that I appreciate about this reading is how it discusses other mapping tools such as GIS, QGIS, and OpenStreetMaps, allowing the reader to better understand who some of the main players in the mapping industry are, which mapping tools have generally been more popular, and what the limitations of some of these programs are. I also appreciate how the OSMnx interface works well with other data sources and works as a relatively open source supplement to other data programs. Regarding the "Off the Grid" reading, I appreciate how the article discusses the history of the American Street Network and trends visible within this network over time. I also appreciated how the final section discusses the implications of trends in the American Street Network and grounds this discussion in more practical terms.           
  
  
**Two Questions for the Author**

1. How has the OSMnx software program evolved since its inception and what are some of its limitations?
2. What do you see as being the most troublesome issue with the American Street Network today and how can mapping help to create a better street network?
