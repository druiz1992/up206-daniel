**Week 4 Individual Assignment - Daniel Ruiz**

For this assignment, I participated in the 4th Annual Humanitarian Mapathon by attending and listening to Ben Welshâ€™s closing keynote. Since he was late, we were able to look at the leader board for the Mapathon, which showed over 20,000 edits to buildings made between both UCLA and USC. It was cool to listen to the experience of some of the participants. During his actual presentation, Welsh discussed the mission of the Data and Graphics Department at the LA Times and what role spatial data analysis has played in this department. I found it interesting how the department has specifically sought to incorporate more data analysis that includes computer code development, computer programmers, and other positions vital to supporting some of the mapping tools that we have learned about in this course so far. Welsh noted that the stories which include a visual story telling component are some of the most popular stories within the LA Times. I appreciated how Welsh made the case for more institutional support for open source programming and improvements to the data infrastructure. More collaboration between entities such as the LA Times, UCLA, and other organizations involved in mapmaking and visually expressing data can ultimately lead to mapping playing a bigger role in determining real life decisions and outcomes in the future.
